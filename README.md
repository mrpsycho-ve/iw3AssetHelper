iw3AssetHelper will work with a `_images` folder, your images will need to end with the full, short or letter of the name of the image type e.g (`_color`, `_col`, `_c`).

# 

<h3 align="left">Steps:</h3>

1. Download lastest from [Releases](https://github.com/mrpsycho-ve/iw3AssetHelper/releases)

2. Make a folder in your cod4 called "autoGDT"

3. Move all content into said folder

4. Have both your model_export folder with your files in open (files can be in subfolders) and the autoGDT folder

5. Select both your vm and wm xmodels and drag them into the iw3AssetHelper.exe, it will create a .GDT file, rename it to what you want e.g t6_m27 and move it to your source_data folder

6. Have both your xanim_export folder with your files in open (files can be in subfolders) and the autoGDT folder

6. Select all your anims and drag them into the iw3AssetHelper.exe, it will create a .GDT file, rename it to what you want e.g t6_m27_anims and move it to your source_data folder

7. Done, open the GDTs and start converting!
