#Note

For iw3AssetHelper to work you'll have to have things named a certain way, your images folder will need to be name "_images" and every image will need the first letter of that image type is e.g colour: imagename_c, imagename_s, imagename_g, imagename_n. 
This is the same for your xmodels, you'll need to name the vm/wm at the start of the file name e.g vm_wpm_xmodel. Anims should be fine with anyname as long as the file name isnt too long.

# Steps

1. Download lastest from Releases

2. Make a folder in your cod4 mod tools called "autoGDT"

3. Move all content into said folder

4. Have both your model_export folder with your files in open (files can be in subfolders) and the autoGDT folder

5. Select both your vm and wm xmodels and drag them into the iw3AssetHelper.exe, it will create a .GDT file named the name of the vm, rename it to what you want e.g t6_m27 and move it to your source_data folder

6. Have both your xanim_export folder with your files in open (files can be in subfolders) and the autoGDT folder

6. Select all your anims and drag them into the iw3AssetHelper.exe, it will create a .GDT file, rename it to what you want e.g t6_m27_anims and move it to your source_data folder

7. Done, open the GDTs and start converting!
